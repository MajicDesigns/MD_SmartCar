This library is designed to provide core mobility functions for an autonomous 2 wheeled Smart Car Robot. The library provides the code infrastructure that allows the car to travel in a controlled manner, on top of which specific applications can confidently be built.

This library is designed around a commonly obtainable 2 wheel drive (plus idler castor wheel) vehicle chassis found on online marketplaces. It is also suitable for more capable similar platforms with little or no modification.
